                        <p>A human mission to Mars has been the subject of science fiction, aerospace engineering, and scientific proposals since the 19th century. The plans comprise proposals to land on Mars, eventually settling on and terraforming the
                            planet, while utilizing its moons, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moons_of_Mars">Phobos and Deimos.</a></p>

                        <p>The exploration of Mars has been a goal of national space programs for decades. Preliminary work for missions that would involve human explorers has been undertaken since the 1950s, with planned missions typically being stated
                            as taking place 10 to 30 years in the future when they are drafted. The List of crewed Mars mission plans shows the various mission proposals that have been put forth by multiple organizations and space agencies in this field
                            of space exploration. Plans have varied from scientific expeditions in which a small (2 to 8) group visits Mars for a period of a few weeks or year, to the permanent colonization of Mars. </p>

                            in books, graphic novels, and films. </p>

                <p>Mars is the focus of much scientific study about possible human colonization. Mars's surface conditions and past presence of liquid water make it arguably the most hospitable planet in the Solar System besides <a href="https://www.google.com/earth/">Earth</a>.
                    Mars requires less energy per unit mass (delta-v) to reach from <a href="https://www.google.com/earth/">Earth</a> than any planet, other than Venus.</p>

                <p>Permanent human habitation on other planets, including Mars, is one of science fiction's most prevalent themes. As technology advances, and concerns about humanity's future on Earth increase, arguments favoring space colonization gain
                    momentum. Other reasons for colonizing space include economic interests, long-term scientific research best carried out by humans as opposed to robotic probes, and sheer curiosity.</p>

                <p>Both private and public organizations have made commitments to researching the viability of long-term colonization efforts and to taking steps toward a permanent human presence on Mars. Space agencies engaged in research or mission planning
                    include
                    <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/"> NASA</a>, Roscosmos, and the China National Space Administration. Private organizations include <a href="https://www.spacex.com/">SpaceX</a>, Lockheed Martin, and Boeing</p>
                <p>Sending humans to Mars is a phenomenal undertaking by all standards and presents very real risks and challenges. Establishing a permanent settlement is very complex, but it is far less complex and requires much less infrastructure sent
                    to Mars than return missions. Mars One has already started contracting established aerospace companies that will be able to develop the required systems.</p>
                <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury. In English, Mars carries a name of the Roman god of war, and is often referred to as the "Red Planet" because the reddish iron oxide
                    prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the
                    impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.</p>

                <p>Mars One aims to establish a permanent human settlement on Mars. Several unmanned missions will be completed, establishing a habitable settlement before carefully selected and trained crews will depart to Mars. Funding and implementing
                    this plan will not be easy, it will be hard. The Mars One team, with its advisers and with established aerospace companies, will evaluate and mitigate risks and identify and overcome difficulties step by step. Mars One is a global
                    initiative whose goal is to make this everyone’s mission to Mars, including yours. If we all work together, we can do this. We’re going to Mars. Come along!</p>

                    <p>Mars presents a hostile environment for human habitation. Different technologies have been developed to assist long-term space exploration and may be adapted for habitation on Mars. The existing record for the longest consecutive space
                        flight is 438 days by cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov, and the most accrued time in space is 878 days by Gennady Padalka. The longest time spent outside the protection of the Earth's Van Allen radiation belt is about 12 days for the
                        Apollo 17 moon landing. This is minor in comparison to the 1100-day journey planned by <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/"> NASA</a> as soon as the year 2028. Scientists have also hypothesized that many different biological functions
                        can be negatively affected by the environment of Mars colonies. Due to higher levels of radiation, there are a multitude of physical side-effects that must be mitigated. In addition Martian soil contains high levels of toxins which
                        are hazardous to human health.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The difference in gravity would negatively affect human health by weakening bones and muscles. There is also risk of osteoporosis and cardiovascular problems. Current rotations on the International Space Station put astronauts in zero
                        gravity for six months, a comparable length of time to a one-way trip to Mars. This gives researchers the ability to better understand the physical state that astronauts going to Mars would arrive in. Once on Mars, surface gravity
                        is only 38% of that on Earth. Upon return to Earth, recovery from bone loss and atrophy is a long process and the effects of microgravity may never fully reverse.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Due to the communication delays, new protocols need to be developed in order to assess crew members' psychological health. Researchers have developed a Martian simulation called HI-SEAS (Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation)
                        that places scientists in a simulated Martian laboratory to study the psychological effects of isolation, repetitive tasks, and living in close-quarters with other scientists for up to a year at a time. Computer programs are being
                        developed to assist crews with personal and interpersonal issues in absence of direct communication with professionals on earth. Current suggestions for Mars exploration and colonization are to select individuals who have passed
                        psychological screenings. Psychosocial sessions for the return home are also suggested in order to reorient people to society.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Various works of fiction put forward the idea of terraforming Mars to allow a wide variety of life forms, including humans, to survive unaided on Mars's surface. Some ideas of possible technologies that may be able to contribute to
                        the actual terraforming of Mars have been conjectured, but none would be able to bring the entire planet into the Earth-like habitat pictured in science fiction</p>
